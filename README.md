# Auto 

This is one page website

This site is used to operate:
- HTML
- CSS
- JS
- Jquery
- MixItUp
- Slick Slider
- Fancybox

To make the site load faster, the files (HTML, CSS, JS) were reduced using galp plugins. The autoprefixer plugin was also used for CSS file.


Things that work on this website:
- Responsive design for mobile devices and for personal computers. For this purpose, media query technology is used. Screen width starting from 320 px to no limits.

- Main menu buttons (Home, About us, Services, Blog, Contact). For this purpose, anchor links are used for this and for soft scrolling use Jquery.

- Mobile main menu (Burger menu) appears when screen size is less than 800 pixels. This menu was completely made by me using JavaScript code. 

- Section "Our blog" - this is fully working section. The MixItUp plugin was used to operate the filter. Link to this plugin: https://www.kunkalabs.com/mixitup/docs/get-started/ .

  The hover effect when hovering the mouse over an article (change the background color to gray and the main title color to green) was developed by me using JavaScript. Here I have applied only one event handler for the whole section.

- Section "Our customers say" - this is fully working section. For this section to work, use Slick Slider. Link to this slider: https://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/ .

- Section "Frequently Asked Questions" - this is fully working section. This section was completely made by me using JavaScript code. 

- Section "Map" - this is fully working section. This section is made using iframe from Google map.
